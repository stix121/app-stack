# AppStack - React Admin & Dashboard Template

This project is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to compile and serve files.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node.js installed, downloadable at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). The required version can be found in the `/.nvmrc` file in the project root. You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Quick Start

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [building for production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.
